## Why the Project?

My goal is to demonstrate my knowledge of laravel and learn about another amazing framework that is vue.js, let both work in harmony.

## Project Preview
This may be an outdated preview and may not represent a final version. (GIF preview coming soon)

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

## About Vue

Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.

## Learning Vue

The ease of vue.js is amazing, you can check all this by studying with the official [documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html).
